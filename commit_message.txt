feat: integrate with demo backend and display accurate cost information

This commit updates the demo frontend to properly display cost information
from the demo backend and ensures seamless integration with the Lighthouse
observability platform.

Cost Display Fixes:
- Updated trace display to show accurate cost values instead of $0.000000
- Implemented proper cost formatting for very small values:
  * Values < $0.0001: Display with 6 decimal places for precision
  * Zero values: Display as "$0.00" for clarity
  * Normal values: Display with 4 decimal places
- Fixed cost parsing from demo backend API response
- Added cost validation to handle edge cases and null values

API Integration:
- Enhanced query submission to properly handle costUsd from demo backend
- Updated trace data structure to include accurate cost information
- Improved error handling for cost-related API responses
- Added logging for cost values received from backend

UI/UX Improvements:
- Updated trace cards to display formatted cost values
- Enhanced trace detail modal with accurate cost information
- Improved visual consistency with main Lighthouse dashboard
- Added cost tooltips or helper text for clarity

Trace Display Enhancements:
- Updated trace list to show cost alongside tokens and latency
- Enhanced trace detail view with properly formatted cost
- Added cost comparison or trend indicators if applicable
- Improved responsive design for cost display on mobile devices

Error Handling:
- Added fallback cost display for missing or invalid cost data
- Implemented graceful degradation when cost calculation fails
- Enhanced error messages for cost-related issues
- Added validation for cost values before display

Integration with Lighthouse:
- Ensured trace data sent to Lighthouse includes accurate cost
- Verified cost data format matches Lighthouse API expectations
- Added cost validation before sending traces to main backend
- Improved trace data completeness for observability

Technical Improvements:
- Updated TypeScript types to ensure costUsd is properly typed
- Added cost calculation utilities if needed client-side
- Improved state management for cost data
- Enhanced API response parsing for cost values
